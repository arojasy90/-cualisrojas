<tr>
<td>Match between System and the Real World </td>
<td>Site used journalistic jargon "Quill." However, when cursor was placed over the word, the site instantly provided further clarification for individuals who may not be aware of the meaning of the "Quill" reference by listing ---> Editorials. <img src="https://github.com/arojasy90/-cualisrojas/blob/main/principle2.png"/></td>

<td>User Control and Freedom</td>
<td>Site lacks a "home" function to return to the main page of the website. It is not intuitive to click on the website's header image to return to the main landing page </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Consistency and Standards</td>
<td>Articles appears multiple times across various site sections. There is no real explanation of the article's inclusion in the multiple sections.

<td>Recognition Rather then Recall</td>
<td>Limited features of navigating the webpage. For example there is no return to the homepage feature or explore similar articles. The only feature available is the "^" return to the top button <img src="https://github.com/arojasy90/-cualisrojas/blob/main/principle6.png"></td>

<td>Flexibility and Efficiency of use</td>
<td>No advance features available to "expert users." Little to no features provided for general population users.</td>

<tr>
<td>Aesthetic/Minimalist Design</td>
<td>The site is extremely distracting. Multiple items are moving a different rates and/or are flashing. These elements causes a competition for the user's attention. The page lacks a "responsive web design" (RWD) that adapts the page to various screen sizes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</td>

<h3>Part 1 Evaluative Summary</h3>

<h4>Strengths</h4>

<ol>
<li>Responsive interface where user input stimulates immediate output (i.e. cursor over Archive link changes the text colors</li>
<li>The site does a great job with providing clarifying details for unfamiliar terminology (Quill-->editorials)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Weakness</h4>

<ol>
<li>Too many interactive displays throughout the web interface. It is very distracting to the user who is seeking information.</li>
<li>There is no error prevention measures to prevent users from unintentionally executing actions.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comparative Analysis of Heuristic review and mini-usability test</h3>

As stated in the directions the mini-usability test was broken into two separate parts. I asked the participant to explore and take note of the various elements on the webpage. After the 5 minute mark, I asked my participant to reflect on the web page layout in comparison to other webpages that they frequently visit. As they compared the site's capabilities, I ask them which specific websites they were utilizing for the comparative analysis. They stated  Newsweek and a Pokémon Database. The participant stated that website lacked a way to easily navigate through content. Further, the participant indicated when they have difficulty finding specific results when they applied the search terms.

The concerns the participant raised were clearly observed as they embarked in the second part of the mini-usability test. While they searching for both Vietnam War and War World II. The user's input were the following: World War 2, World War II, and Vietnam War. The output included titles with individual words from the input. Many of the results did not have high relevancy to the original search input. As I discovered in the Heuristic analysis many of the results were repeats of the same articles which cluttered the output results. Although, the list of Archived materials exceed the sizing of the screen and there was no function to expand or collapse the archived years, the archive list was used efficiently by the participant. 

My suggestions for the webpage is to remove the "moving" images and articles to simplify the layout and to not produce distractions for the users. The next suggestion is to put in advance search query capabilities. User's without Boolean search knowledge will have to shift through an immense amount of material before they will find relevant results. The last suggestion, is to produce "similar articles" through the usage of metadata terms linked to each article.
